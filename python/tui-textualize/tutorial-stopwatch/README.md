# Textualize Stopwatch Tutorial

Reviewed the stopwatch tutorial as found on the main Textualize [tutorial page](https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/), but expanded on it to represent a Python application that was broken up between files. All of the Class objects are in their own `model.py` file and the `TCSS` is handled in a directory named `static` to loosely follow a standard flask web application. The only addition to this example tutorial is I added a `Quit` action to the TUI just to see what that logic looked like for the `BINDINGS` tuple.
